# Project Prometheus Status Document

Last Updated: [Current Date]

## Project Overview
Project Prometheus is a decentralized platform for venture communes, focusing on communal ownership and democratic control of productive assets.

## Current Phase
Initial Development

## Recent Accomplishments
- Set up GitHub repository and project board
- Created initial project structure and documentation
- Set up development environment
- Defined initial API endpoints
- Designed and implemented database schema

## Current Task
- Design database schema (completed)

## Next Tasks
- Implement data storage and retrieval in API endpoints
- Implement basic user authentication
- Develop frontend skeleton

## Open Issues/Challenges
- Need to implement proper error handling and input validation in API endpoints

## Project Board Status
- Backlog: 5 items
- Ready: 2 items
- In Progress: 0 items
- Review: 1 item (Design database schema)
- Done: 3 items (Create GitHub repository structure, Set up development environment, Define initial API endpoints)

## Recent Code Changes
- Created initial API structure with endpoints for communes, assets, and projects
- Designed and implemented database schema using SQLAlchemy ORM

## Environment Setup
- Python version: 3.8+ (verify with `python --version`)
- Key dependencies: Flask 2.0.1, SQLAlchemy 1.4.23, Flask-RESTful 0.3.9, Werkzeug 2.0.1

## Notes for AI Assistant
- Provide guidance on implementing CRUD operations using SQLAlchemy in the API endpoints
- Suggest best practices for error handling and input validation in Flask applications

## Additional Context
The project now has a basic API structure and database schema in place. The next step is to integrate these components by implementing actual data storage and retrieval in the API endpoints.
