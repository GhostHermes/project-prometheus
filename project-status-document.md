# Project Prometheus Status Document

Last Updated: June 20, 2024

## Project Overview
Project Prometheus is a decentralized platform for venture communes, focusing on communal ownership, democratic control of productive assets, and horizontal distribution of power. It utilizes blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies to create a truly decentralized ecosystem.

## Current Phase
Architectural Redesign and Initial Implementation

## Recent Accomplishments
- Pivoted to a decentralized, peer-to-peer architecture
- Researched and selected core technologies for DID, P2P networking, and blockchain integration
- Updated project documentation to reflect new direction

## Current Task
- Set up basic P2P network with DID capabilities

## Next Tasks
- Implement distributed storage solution (e.g., IPFS)
- Develop smart contracts for core functionalities
- Design and implement federation protocols
- Create DApp user interface

## Open Issues/Challenges
- Selecting the most appropriate blockchain platform for our needs
- Ensuring scalability and performance in a fully decentralized system
- Developing user-friendly interfaces for complex decentralized interactions
- Ensuring compliance with regulations in a decentralized context

## Project Board Status
- Backlog: 5 items (Including long-term goals like advanced governance mechanisms)
- Ready: 3 items (P2P network setup, DID implementation, Distributed storage integration)
- In Progress: 1 item (Basic P2P network with DID capabilities)
- Review: 1 item (Technology selection and architecture design)
- Done: 2 items (Initial project setup, Pivot to decentralized architecture)

## Recent Code Changes
- Repository structure updated to accommodate new architecture
- Initial P2P networking code implemented

## Environment Setup
- Core technologies: To be finalized, but likely including:
  - Decentralized Identity (DID): Hyperledger Indy or uPort
  - P2P Networking: libp2p
  - Distributed Storage: IPFS
  - Blockchain Platform: To be determined (e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos, or custom solution)

## Notes for AI Assistant
- Provide guidance on implementing DIDs and P2P networking
- Suggest best practices for developing and testing decentralized applications
- Research and compare different blockchain platforms suitable for our use case

## Additional Context
The project has pivoted to a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer model to better align with its goals of horizontal power distribution. This shift will require significant changes in our approach to development, testing, and deployment, but will result in a system that truly embodies the principles of decentralized power and collective ownership.
