# Project Prometheus Status Document

Last Updated: June 20, 2024

## Project Overview
Project Prometheus is a decentralized platform for venture communes, focusing on communal ownership and democratic control of productive assets.

## Current Phase
Initial Development

## Recent Accomplishments
- Set up GitHub repository and project board
- Created initial project structure and documentation
- Set up development environment
- Defined initial API endpoints
- Designed and implemented database schema
- Implemented CRUD operations for Commune entity
- Fixed JSON serialization issue in API responses
- Implemented CRUD operations for User entity
- Implemented CRUD operations for Project entity
- Fixed date handling for Project entity

## Current Task
- Implement CRUD operations for Asset entity

## Next Tasks
- Implement basic user authentication
- Develop frontend skeleton
- Add comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Implement relationships between entities (e.g., linking projects to communes)

## Open Issues/Challenges
- Need to implement proper error handling and input validation in API endpoints
- Consider implementing data validation and sanitization
- Asset endpoints still return placeholder messages

## Project Board Status
- Backlog: 2 items
- Ready: 2 items
- In Progress: 1 item (Implement CRUD operations for Asset entity)
- Review: 1 item (Implement CRUD operations for Project entity)
- Done: 8 items (Create GitHub repository structure, Set up development environment, Define initial API endpoints, Design database schema, Implement data storage and retrieval for Commune entity, Implement CRUD operations for User entity, Implement CRUD operations for Project entity, Fix date handling for Project entity)

## Recent Code Changes
- Implemented CRUD operations for Project entity in api.py
- Updated API routing to include Project endpoints
- Fixed date handling for Project entity to work with SQLite

## Environment Setup
- Python version: 3.8+ (verify with `python --version`)
- Key dependencies: Flask 2.0.1, SQLAlchemy 1.4.23, Flask-RESTful 0.3.9, Werkzeug 2.0.1

## Notes for AI Assistant
- Provide guidance on implementing CRUD operations for Asset entity
- Suggest best practices for error handling and input validation in Flask applications
- Consider discussing strategies for implementing user authentication

## Additional Context
The project now has a functional API with CRUD operations for Commune, User, and Project entities. The next steps involve implementing CRUD operations for the Asset entity, then moving on to authentication and security features.
