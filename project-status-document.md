# Project Prometheus Status Document

Last Updated: June 20, 2024

## Project Overview
Project Prometheus is a decentralized platform for venture communes, focusing on communal ownership and democratic control of productive assets.

## Current Phase
Initial Development

## Recent Accomplishments
- Set up GitHub repository and project board
- Created initial project structure and documentation
- Set up development environment
- Defined initial API endpoints
- Designed and implemented database schema
- Implemented CRUD operations for Commune entity
- Fixed JSON serialization issue in API responses
- Implemented CRUD operations for User entity

## Current Task
- Implement CRUD operations for Asset and Project entities

## Next Tasks
- Implement basic user authentication
- Develop frontend skeleton
- Add input validation and error handling

## Open Issues/Challenges
- Need to implement proper error handling and input validation in API endpoints
- Consider implementing data validation and sanitization
- Asset and Project endpoints still return placeholder messages

## Project Board Status
- Backlog: 2 items
- Ready: 2 items
- In Progress: 1 item (Implement CRUD operations for Asset and Project entities)
- Review: 1 item (Implement CRUD operations for User entity)
- Done: 6 items (Create GitHub repository structure, Set up development environment, Define initial API endpoints, Design database schema, Implement data storage and retrieval for Commune entity, Implement CRUD operations for User entity)

## Recent Code Changes
- Implemented CRUD operations for User entity in api.py
- Updated API routing to include User endpoints

## Environment Setup
- Python version: 3.8+ (verify with `python --version`)
- Key dependencies: Flask 2.0.1, SQLAlchemy 1.4.23, Flask-RESTful 0.3.9, Werkzeug 2.0.1

## Notes for AI Assistant
- Provide guidance on implementing CRUD operations for Asset and Project entities
- Suggest best practices for error handling and input validation in Flask applications
- Consider discussing strategies for testing API endpoints

## Additional Context
The project now has a functional API with CRUD operations for Commune and User entities. The next steps involve extending this functionality to Asset and Project entities, then moving on to authentication and security features.
