# Project Prometheus

Project Prometheus is a decentralized platform for venture communes, focusing on communal ownership, democratic control of productive assets, and horizontal distribution of power.

## Vision

Our vision is to create a truly decentralized ecosystem that empowers workers and enables the formation and operation of venture communes. By leveraging blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, we aim to facilitate collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among venture communes and their members, fostering the growth of a resilient and interconnected network of worker-owned cooperatives.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Decentralized Identity (DID) for secure and self-sovereign identities
- Peer-to-peer networking for direct communication between nodes
- Distributed storage for decentralized data management
- Smart contracts for automated governance and asset management
- Federation protocols for inter-commune collaboration
- Decentralized governance and decision-making
- Transparent and equitable value distribution

## Technology Stack

- Decentralized Identity: [To be determined, e.g., Hyperledger Indy, uPort]
- P2P Networking: libp2p
- Distributed Storage: IPFS
- Blockchain Platform: [To be determined, e.g., Ethereum, Cosmos, or custom solution]
- Smart Contracts: Solidity (if using Ethereum) or appropriate language for chosen platform
- DApp Frontend: Web3.js, React.js
