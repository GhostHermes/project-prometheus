# Project Prometheus

Project Prometheus is an initiative to create a decentralized platform that empowers workers and enables the formation and operation of venture communes, focusing on communal ownership and democratic control of productive assets.

## Vision

Our vision is to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and mutual support among venture communes and their members, facilitating the growth of a resilient and interconnected ecosystem of worker-owned cooperatives.

## Key Features (Planned)

- Decentralized governance and decision-making
- Communal asset management and ownership tracking
- Production coordination and workflow automation
- Knowledge sharing and collaborative learning
- Equitable value distribution and social impact metrics
- Decentralized marketplace and fair exchange mechanisms
- Reputation and trust building systems
